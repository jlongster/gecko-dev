# Firefox Developer Tools

Hello! Welcome to documentation for the Firefox developer tools. In
here we explain high-level concepts about how things work, like our
frontend architecture and the remote debugging protocol. We may also
have API docs here too.

I'm not sure how to include a table of contents here yet, but check
out the left-hand panel for more content.
